# Deep Learning for Crop Mapping

Welcome to our repository where we explore the cutting-edge of deep learning architectures applied to crop mapping. This project aims to enhance crop classification accuracy by using the power of AI.

Overview
This repository contains a series of experiments and implementations of various deep learning models designed to identify, classify, and map different crop types using satellite imagery. By integrating different architectures, our goal is to compare their effectiveness and accuracy in real-world scenarios, contributing to the optimasation of crop type predictions and land use efficiency.

Models Explored
1D-CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Tailored for processing 2D imagery, used to capture spatial hierarchies in data.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): Applied to temporal sequences, ideal for analyzing changes over time in crop growth.
Transformer Models: Utilized for large-scale and high-resolution imagery, focusing on capturing complex, long-range dependencies.

Dataset
The datasets used in this project are sourced from public satellite imagery (mainly Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) and agricultural surveys conducted by Chinses Academy of Agriculture Science (CAAS).

Tools and Technologies
